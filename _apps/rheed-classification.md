# Development of an AI-powered manufacturing process for thin-film growth

> This is a part of product for a recent project I am working on, i.e., development of an AI-powered manufacturing process for thin-film growth.

> This application is deployed with two replicated sets on a Kubernetes cluster ([McGill MatNavi]({{ "/idea/cloud/Infrastructure-for-next-generation-material-infomatics-platform/" | relative_url }})) I built.

> In the backend, the CNN models for image classification are deployed as REST API with two replicated sets on [McGill MatNavi]({{ "/idea/cloud/Infrastructure-for-next-generation-material-infomatics-platform/" | relative_url }})

> More RHEED images need to be labeled.
