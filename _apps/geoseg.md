# Geospatial object detection and segmentation

> Dataset: [NWPU-VHR-10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2aE3uDRckIqjXlUUuDNmYzXJohlh3RJ/view?usp=sharing)

> Model: Mask R-CNN

> mAP (IOU = 0.5): 0.973

> mAR (max detections per image = 100): 0.770

> This application is deployed with two replicated sets on a Kubernetes cluster

> Things need to do next: May need more samples for some classes to improve the recall.
