> Dataset: [Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/c/3d-object-detection-for-autonomous-vehicles/data)

> Visualization: Pydeck

> Things to do: 

* Reproduce the result of [3D U-Net model](https://www.kaggle.com/phunghieu/getting-started-with-3d-semantic-segmentation)
* Try [ShellConv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06295.pdf), which is light weight and more effienct, for point cloud segmentation.
* Try [rotation invariant Convolutions for 3D Point Clouds Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06297.pdf)
