In this post, I will show you how to deploy jupyterHub with Kubernetes on OpenStack. 
More specifically, I will attempt to build a academic cloud computing environment on Compute Canada Cloud.

This post is split into three parts (see links below)


Part 1) [Deploy Kubernetes with kubespray on OpenStack]({{ "/tutorial/cloud/deploy-kubernetes-with-kubespray-on-openstack" | relative_url }})

Part 2) [Deploy Heketi-Glusterfs for dynamic storage]({{ "/tutorial/cloud/deploy-heketi-glusterfs-for-dynamic-storage" | relative_url }})

Part 3) [Deploy and set up JupyterHub]({{ "/tutorial/cloud/deploy-and-configure-jupyterhub" | relative_url }})
