title: Deploying JupyterHub with Kubernetes on OpenStack from scratch
---

In this post, I will show you how to deploy jupyterHub with Kubernetes on OpenStack. 
More specifically, I will attempt to build a academic cloud computing environment on Compute Canada Cloud.

This post is split into three parts (see links below)

Part 1) [Deploy Kubernetes with kubespray on OpenStack]({{ site.baseurl }}/Deploy-Kubernetes-with-kubespray-on-OpenStack)

Part 2) [Deploy Heketi-Glusterfs for dynamic storage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Deploy-Kubernetes-with-kubespray-on-OpenStack)

Part 3) [Deploy and set up JupyterHub]({{ site.baseurl }}/Deploy-Kubernetes-with-kubespray-on-OpenStack)
